# support_vector_regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, which means it is used to predict a continuous target variable, rather than a categorical one. SVR is a variation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is primarily used for classification tasks.
